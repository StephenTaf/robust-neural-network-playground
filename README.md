### Render Demo

There are two rendering versions available: **render_polygons.py** and **render_graphics.py**.

To test one of them in the python REPL, move to directory ui with ```cd ui``` and move to your python REPL via ```python```.
Inside the REPL, import the python file via ```import render_polygons.py as render``` or ```import render_graphics.py as render``` and execute the test function via ```render.test()```.
